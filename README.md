# GotoMarket_PropTech
Market trial of one-click buy then rent properties.

This analysis is for Proptech to further understand the ROI for one-click service, to buy properties then rent them.  
This trial offering went to market in San Fransico real-estate.  I advised if Proptech is able to find neighborhoods where rental is high-demand such as San Fransico then one-click, buy-and-rent strategy will be profitable and Proptech should expand.

I used hvplot.pandas to visualize analysis by plots.  I included bokeh extension, for the ability to create a table next to the OSM tile plot, which is the last chart created; however, Github did not pull the visual shown below into repository.
